1.	Initial State: Random shuffle of puzzle pieces.
2.	Neighbour Function: Swap two random pieces.
3.	Energy Function:
o	Compare edges of adjacent pieces.
o	If edges match → lower cost, if mismatch → higher cost.
o	Example: Left edge of piece(i) ≠ Right edge of piece(j) → add penalty.
4.	Acceptance Rule:
o	If arrangement improves (lower mismatch), accept.
o	Else accept with probability exp(-(ΔE)/T).
5.	Cooling Schedule: Gradually reduce T until convergence.
6.	Goal State: All edges match → correct reconstruction of image.
