Put start state into priority queue with f(n) = g(n) + h(n).
g(n) = moves taken so far.
	h(n) = heuristic estimate.
	While queue is not empty:
	Remove state with lowest f(n).
	If it is a goal state → return solution.
	Otherwise expand neighbors and insert them with their f(n).
	If queue empty → failure.
In the game: A* balances moves done + heuristic, so it avoids dead-ends.
